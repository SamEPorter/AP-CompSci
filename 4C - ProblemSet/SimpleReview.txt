MY PARTNER GOT FOOD POISONING FROM THEIR POT ROAST DINNER AND WENT TO EMERGENCY ROOM.  CALLED MANAGER AND EXPLAINED HOW OFTEN WE EAT THERE AND HAVE NEVER HAD A REASON TO COMPLAIN BEFORE, EXCEPT HE IS STILL VERY ILL.  WE GO TO THIS STORE ONCE A WEEK AND THE MANAGER SAID THEY HAVE NEVER IN THEIR STORE HISTORY HAD ONE COMPLAINT OF THIS TYPE AND THAT WE WOULD NEVER GET COMPENSATION FOR MY PARTNER'S DISH.  STAY AWAY, HE HIMSELF LOOKS VERY UNHYGENIC AND SLOPPY DRESSED.  WE DON'T LIKE COMPLAINING, BUT THIS COULD HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE WITH THIS PARTICULAR DISH AND THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THAT.

HOPE YOU HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE.

DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST.

Quick update.  My partner is still in VGH hospital and the doctor has taken samples from the oral discharge showing that he has been poisoned with ecoli.  Now we have informed our family solicitor who says the way that manager handled such a seriousness situation, he is confident that we will most certainly receive compensation for beyond what we asked for.  WE only wanted him to report the issue to appropriate health authority.  This post was only to let others know how much they really care. At least now the health authority will make sure that their kitchen and food handling and storage will be thoroughly.  Hope that this will benefit this store's patrons.
